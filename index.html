                <p>I had completed car racing game.The car racing game is a simple Java powered 2D game. This game consists of single level or stage to play the game. We have to control the car from colliding with other cars. This game is very much fun and interesting to play.
                    This is a 2-d car racing game. The objective of the game is to prevent our car from crashing into opponents car. The opponents car come from opposite direction and with variable speed.

                <p>I developed this project in c++.A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list
                    includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a
                    customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system
                    searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate
                    message is displayed.
